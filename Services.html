Whether you drive a twin-turbo charged 997 or an air-cooled 3.2 911, staying current on your vehicle maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in the long run. &nbsp;Regardless of the year, model or engine type, it is important that you regularly maintain your Porsche.In general, you should expect to service your Porsche every 10,000 miles or once per year. Experience has shown that a minor service including oil, filters, and inspection will cost between $200 and $400, while a major service including transmission services will cost between $400 and $600. &nbsp;Although not tied to a regularly scheduled maintenance brakes are another common maintenance item.Current Porsche braking systems use compound materials and depending on your specific model, a complete brake job front and rear will typically cost between $900 and $1800. It is important to use the proper grade brake pads and brake rotors for your specific Porsche.&nbsp;Remember NOT ALL BRAKES ARE CREATED EQUALLY. The old adage of you get what you pay for applies. You can spend $70 on a set of brake pads or you can spend $270 depending on your specific model and the performance level you are looking for.You should stay away from cheap aftermarket brakes that will not stop your Porsche as it is designed. Ceramic brake pads are a good aftermarket alternative and have the advantage of lower dust. Expect to pay a comparable amount to a Porsche OEM pad, but with increased stopping grip and less dust. &nbsp;Please stop by German Auto Center and we will be happy to print a maintenance schedule for your specific Porsche or other German performance automobile.&nbsp;to help you fix those, without risk or judgment, and move forward.

                <h4 class="u-text u-text-5"> What should I expect to pay for a Porsche oil change?</h4>
                <p class="u-text u-text-6"> The primary cost to an oil change on your Porsche is the oil itself. Today’s higher performance synthetic oils used in all late model Porsche engines can cost between $8 and $10 per liter and depending on your engine, your Porsche will use between 7 and 10 liters. Please see our&nbsp;technical tips section&nbsp;for more information regarding engine oils.We at German Auto Center can not stress enough the importance of using the right oil for your vehicle. Remember all newer engines as well as all turbo charged engines must use a full synthetic oil such as Mobil 1. Older Porsches used mineral based oils and should not be replaced with synthetic oils.As the environment in Austin Texas is a little hotter than what is found in Germany, German Auto Center recommends changing your engine oil more frequently than the Porsche recommended service intervals of 10,000 miles. If you drive a turbo-charged model, we recommend changing your oil every 5,000 miles due to the extreme heat these engines produce; late model non-turbo charged engines should change oil every 7,500 miles. Even with today’s engine compartment fans, we see even the toughest synthetic oils breaking down. On older models or models using mineral based oil, we recommend changing your oil every 5,000 miles.</p>

                <p class="u-text u-text-8"> There is no way to really answer what you should pay for a repair on your Porsche. Common repairs related to vacuum leaks, oil leaks and coolant leaks can vary widely from $200 vacuum leak to a $600 oil separator or $900 water pump. Please contact the experts and German Auto Center and we will be happy to give you a detailed estimate. As always, German Auto Center will save you significantly over comparable repairs at the Porsche dealer or from a general repair shop that does not specialize in Porsche vehicles.</p>
